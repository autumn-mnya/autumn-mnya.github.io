# 1.4 - Backgrounds

Backgrounds are stored in the `data` folder as `.bmp` files with a `Bk` prefix (Example: `BkBlue.bmp`). They are choosen per stage therefore are loaded from a Stage Table entry parameter. The other Stage Table entry parameter related to backgrounds is "Scroll Type" and it determines the background's scroll type.
