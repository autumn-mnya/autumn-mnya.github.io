# 3 - Lua Scripting

The main feature of ModCS is its **Lua Scripting API**, which allows for advanced Cave Story modifications without the use of Assembly or C. Currently the API has enough features for modifying HUD, advanced modifying of NPCs, making NPCs and custom TSC commands. This chapter of the guide will go over basic usage of the drawing and NPC APIs. By the end of this guide you should be able to:

- Make custom HUD elements.

- Modify sprites of already existing NPCs.

- Make custom NPCs and enemies from scratch.

Lua is an incredibly easy scripting language to learn and during the course of this guide it's assumed that the reader will be learn it on the go. This is *not* a general Lua scripting guide, but if you are struggling with keeping up you may want to check out [this Lua tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm).
