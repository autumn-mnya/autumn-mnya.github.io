# 1 - Basics

After you've downloaded ModCS and launched your editor of choice, it's time to start making your mod.

To open your mod in an editor go to File -> Load and navigate to your **Mod's `data` folder**. There load `stage.tbl`.

!!! Note
	The King's Table uses a different system for loading mods. You will have to open your `stage.tbl` file from File -> New. Afterwards, press File -> Save Project to save a *The King's Table project file* for your mod. Any time you want to load your mod afterwards press File -> Load and open your project file.

??? Note "Loading Different Engines"
	You will have to load different things for different Cave Story engines. For CSE2 Enhanced you may load a `mrmap.bin`. For Freeware modding you will have to load your mod EXE. If you will be modding freeware it's very important to press File -> Save All right after you have loaded your EXE.
