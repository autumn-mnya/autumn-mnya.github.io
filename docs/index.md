# ModCS

This is a new site for the documentation of **ModCS**, a Cave Story modding lua scripting API.
It allows you to make custom hud elements, easily modify and make NPCs, create custom weapons and
create custom TextScript commands.

This project originally was developed by aikyuu and yasinbread, and the [old site](https://modcavestory.github.io) for ModCS
is now currently out-of-date with the new features that have been added since.

The current day of ModCS would not be the same without their hard work, so thank them for the creation of this tool!
