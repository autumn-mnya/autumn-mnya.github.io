# Pixel Unit

A **Pixel Unit** represents an in-game space coordinate. While sprites on the screen use screen coordinates, objects such as [NPCs](/api/objects/npc/), [Carets](/api/objects/caret/), etc. use pixel units. You may use nonintegral values as pixel units but they will always be rounded to the nearest subpixel (1/512th of a pixel).
