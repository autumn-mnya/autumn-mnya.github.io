<h1>~ About ~</h1>
<p>Ikachan is a game released in 1999 by Daisuke Amaya, better known as Studio Pixel.<br>In 2020, CuckyDev started a decompilation of the game.</p>
<p>This is an updated version of Ikachan to add widescreen, running in 480x270 rather than 320x240.<br>This is a clean upscale to 1080p, so the game looks really good on modern displays!<br>There is also a new toggle between 50 and 60fps, so that you can play the game at a faster speed.</p>
<p>New "widescreen" art had to be made for it to look reasonable, so Eli made some nice upscaled art of 2 of the bmp's in the game.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The game's files have also been reorganized so that it's cleaner overall, taking inspiration from how Cave Story<br>does its file structure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tip: if you create a blank file named "fps" in the games folder, the game's current framerate will display in the top right,<br>like how the Japanese release does.</p>
