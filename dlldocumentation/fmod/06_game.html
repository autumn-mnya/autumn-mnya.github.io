<h1># Playing an Event In-Game #</h1>
<p>Playing an event In-Game is quite simple!<br>
First off, it's good to know that the tsc command "&lt;CMU" doesn't play a FMOD event.<br>
In-fact, Cave Story organya audio is not touched at all, and you can play both at the same time.<br>
This usually isn't the wanted effect, so just use a &lt;CMU0000 before playing FMOD events.</p>
<hr>
<p>To play your event in game though, you're going to want to use the new "&lt;PEV" TSC command.<br>
Documentation on the new TSC commands are included with the dll, but I'll explain how to play an event anyways here.<br>
The &lt;PEV command can't normally detect the end of your event string, so the &lt;PEV event has to end with a "$" at the end.<br>
When playing our event, we want to do "&lt;PEVevent:/Example$". This will play an event named "Example".<br>
It should start playing in-game afterwards. Congratulations!<br><br><br>
Note: If you get a TSC error, then the DLL most likely is not loaded.</p>
