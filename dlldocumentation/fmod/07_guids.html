<h1># Sending your Banks to Others (GUIDs.txt creation) #</h1>
<p>Now that you've gotten your bank useable, It's time to discuss sending the banks to other people if you're creating banks for other people, or if its part of a collab.<br>
Firstly, we need to understand how bank creation works.<br>
When you build your bank -- a "Master.strings.bank" file gets created. We do NOT want to send this to other people.<br>
First off, make sure your events are NOT set to build to the master bank. Create a new bank and name it something unique. Assign your events to that new bank then continue.<br>
Once you've done that, build that bank file.<br>Then, in the top left of FMOD Studio, go to "File: -> "Export GUIDs...".</p>
<img src="images/07/01.png" alt="Export GUIDs" class="center" style="width:280px;height:450px;">>
<p>Once you've clicked that button, it should immediately tell you where it placed that text file.<br>
If you followed the Bank Directory tutorial, in theory it should be directly in the games "data/audio" folder.<br>
Move it into the "/Desktop/" folder, and rename it so it matches this format:<br>
bankname.guids.txt<br>
So, if your banks filename was "Example.bank", you'd name the guids file "Example.guids.txt". That's it! It should load for other people now.<br>
Once again, DO NOT SEND PEOPLE "Master.strings.bank", and DO NOT BUILD THE MASTER BANK when creating your audio!! That also means don't rename the master bank in FMOD Studio, either.</p>
