<h1># Creating a New Event #</h1>
<p>Here, I'll teach you how to create a new event in FMOD studio for your mod.<br>
Assuming you've done all of the previous steps, you're now ready to import audio into your FMOD project!</p>
<hr>
<p>Firstly, Go to the Events tab in the top left.<br>
[ DO NOT TOUCH THE NULL FOLDER OR ANYTHING INSIDE OF IT ]<br>
You're going to want to create a "New Event", as seen in the bottom left.<br>
Name it whatever you want. For this example, I'll name mine "Example".</p>
<img src="images/04/01.png" alt="Example" class="center" style="width:300px;height:160px;">
<p>After that, you're going to want to right click on it, and assign it to a Bank.<br>
In most cases, you can just assign it to the Master Bank, but you make your own bank if you want to.</p>
<img src="images/04/02.png" alt="Assign to Bank" class="center" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<p>Once you've done that, this next part is INCREDIBLY important.<br>
Press Ctrl + 2 (Or Command + 2 on Mac, I believe) to open up the "Mixer" window.</p>
<img src="images/04/03.png" alt="Mixer" class="center" style="width:300px;height:450px;">
<p>Here, we need to tell the game which group our audio belongs in. There are 8 total, as you cannot create more.<br>
In most cases, you're just going to want to use group 0 (Music).<br>
To do this, right click on your audio, and then "Reroute" it into the Music group.</p>
<img src="images/04/04.png" alt="Reroute" class="center" style="width:620px;height:240px;">
<p>After that's done, you can close the Mixer window.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now we need to get ready to add your audio. Click on your event in the "Events" Tab, first.<br>
Once done, click in the dark area to the right of the event list. Here, select "Add Timeline Sheet"</p>
<img src="images/04/05.png" alt="Reroute" class="center" style="width:480px;height:220px;">
<p>After you've done that, right click on the text that says "Master" and add a new audio track.<br>
Our audio will go there!</p>
<img src="images/04/06.png" alt="Master" class="center" style="width:200px;height:120px;">
<p>
(You can also create multiple audio tracks, but you can read the
<a href="https://fmod.com/docs/2.02/studio/welcome-to-fmod-studio.html" style="color:cyan";>FMOD Studio Documentation</a>
to learn more about that)<br>
After you've created your audio track, find your audio file of choice on your PC. Drag it onto the "Audio 1" timeline!</p>
<img src="images/04/07.png" alt="Drag Audio" class="center">
<p>Once it's in your timeline, right click on the audio waveform. Select "New Loop Region".<br>
Use this however you like to set where your song will loop!</p>
<img src="images/04/08.png" alt="Loop Region" class="center" style="width:425px;height:260px;">
<p>Once you've done all of this, you're ready to finally build your bank and test it in game!<br>
Note: All events in-game start with "event:/".<br>
The event name in-game for this example would be "event:/Example", just for reference.</p>
